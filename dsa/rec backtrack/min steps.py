"""
Clearer Function Definition: The function signature is more descriptive, explaining each parameter.
Base Case: The code now correctly handles the base case when the current_step equals target_step. It updates the min_steps list only if a valid path is found.
Dead End Handling: The code now includes a check for potential dead ends (if the current step exceeds the target step). This prevents infinite recursion and incorrect results.
Smaller Steps Exploration: The code now explores smaller steps (1 or 2) if larger steps lead to a dead end. This ensures that the algorithm finds the most efficient path, even if the larger steps don't directly lead to the target.
Min Steps Tracking: The code uses a list min_steps to track the minimum number of steps found so far. This is important because the function is called recursively.
Initialization of min_steps: The min_steps list is initialized with infinity to ensure that the first valid solution found is correctly recorded.
Incrementing Steps: The code now correctly increments the number of steps only when a valid path is found (when min_steps[0] is not infinity). If no valid path is found, it resets min_steps[0] to infinity.
Example Usage: The example usage is more helpful and includes the necessary initialization of variables.
Return Value: The function now returns the minimum number of steps.
Docstring: The function has a docstring explaining what it does, the parameters it takes, and the return value.
Comments: The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand.
