Graphs
A graph is a way of representing relationships that exist between pairs of objects.
That is, a graph is a set of objects, called vertices, together with a collection of
pairwise connections between them, called edges. Graphs have applications in
modeling many domains, including mapping, transportation, computer networks,
and electrical engineering.

a graph G is simply a set V of vertices and a collection E of pairs of vertices from V, called edges.
Thus, a graph is a way of representing connections or relationships between pairs of objects from some setV.

Edges in a graph are either directed or undirected.
An edge (u,v) is said to be directed from u t v if the pair (u,v) is ordered, with u preceding v. An edge(u,v)
is said to be undirected if the pair (u,v) is not ordered. Undirected edges are sometimes denoted with set notation,
as {u,v},

Example 14.3: A city map can be modeled as a graph whose vertices are intersec￾tions or dead ends, and whose edges are stretches of streets without intersections.
This graph has both undirected edges, which correspond to stretches of two-way
streets, and directed edges, which correspond to stretches of one-way streets. Thus,
in this way, a graph modeling a city map is a mixed graph.
