Graph traversal algorithms are methods for systematically visiting each node in a graph, exploring
its connections in a specific order. Two fundamental algorithms are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and
Depth-First Search (DFS), which offer different approaches to traversing the graph. Other algorithms
like Dijkstra's and A* are used for finding shortest paths, while topological sorting can be used
for specific graph traversal scenarios.

Key Graph Traversal Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Explores all neighbors of a node at the current level before moving to the next level. It uses a queue
to maintain the order of exploration, ensuring the shortest path is found in unweighted graphs.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack to keep track of
visited nodes, allowing for in-depth exploration of the graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge
weights. It's a greedy algorithm that prioritizes nodes with the shortest distance from the source.

A Search Algorithm:*
An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide its search for the shortest
path, often used in pathfinding problems.

Topological Sorting:
Used for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to order nodes in a way that no node comes before its parents.
