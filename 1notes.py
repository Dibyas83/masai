pypi
There’s also my Standard Library: a collection
of included code libraries which help with all manner of
programming problems. And, of course, there’s PyPI?
Head First: Py…P… what?!?
Python: Py…P…I, which is shorthand for the Python
Package Index, an online, globally accessible repository
of shareable third-party Python modules. These help
programmers tackle every conceivable programming
problem you can think of. It’s a wonderful community
resource.
Head First: So this PyPI thing lets you exploit other
programmer’s code without writing your own?

BIFs, my built-in functions. These
are little powerhouses of generic functionality that work
in lots of places and situations.
Head First: Provide our readers with a quick example.
Python: Consider len, which is shorthand for “length.”
Give len an object, and it reports how big the object is.
Head First: Thank heavens I’m sitting down.
Python: Ha ha. I know it sounds trivial, but len’s a bit
of a wonder. Give len a list, and it tells you how many
objects are in the list. Give it a string, and len tells you
how many characters are in the string, and so on and so
forth. If an object can report its size, len can tell you
what it is.
