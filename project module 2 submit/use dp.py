Using Top-Down DP (Memoization) â€“ O(n*n*2^n) Time and O(n*2^n) Space
If we observe closely, we can see that the recursive relation tsp() in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exhibits the overlapping subproblems, where the same subproblems are recalculated multiple times in different recursion paths. To optimize this, we can use memoization to store the results of previously computed subproblems, thus avoiding redundant calculations.


In this case, there are two parameters that change: mask, which represents the cities visited so far, and curr, which represents the current city. Since both parameters have a finite range (i.e., mask can have up to 2^n distinct values and curr can take n possible values), we can use a 2D array of size n x (1<<n) to store the results for each combination of mask and curr and initialize it as -1 to indicate that the values are not computed.
